This is a python API designed to interact with the OLED library which is found here: https://github.com/gangrif/HackMyDerby2015/tree/master/scripts/oled

A copy of this library is included here. 

This is a work in progress.  Executing main.py starts an api on port 5002.  You can call it via curl, and display things on your OLED display. 

This assumes you have a Raspberry Pi working, with a winstar 16x2 character OLED.
